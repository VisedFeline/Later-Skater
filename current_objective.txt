Make demo of Skater Boy / Later Skater (placeholer):
Main idea is treadmill while the player controls speed and is supposed to avoid obstacles

Main mechanic / motivation:
 - Go as fast and as recklessly as possible

How to incentivise desired behaivior?
 - Point system, where speed and airtime equal more points. Also a leaderboard displaying fictional / real high scores.
 - Punish slow speed and no jumping. Either by increasing acceleration, obstacles amount etc...
 - Aesthetic reinforcement
 - Add "obstacles" for acceleration (such as oil, trampoline, hold onto car, etc...)
 - Consider NOT adding a pause option

Current TODO:
 - Decide how to prioritize nodes rendering [X]

 - Implement character speed [1/2]
  - Add basic acceleration [X]
  - Add breaks

 - Decide and implement how enemy generation pace progresses []

 - Implement road borders [X]

 - Implement random obstacle generation [x]

 - Implement collision with obstacles [1/2]
  - Implement collision detection [X]
  - Implement collision behaviours []
   - losing
   - hopping
 
 - Implement level acceleration []

 - Implement and design obstacle hopping []
 
 - Point system:
  - Design point system
  - Implement it

 - Design and implement game play flow:
  - Start
  - Play
  - Add name to leader(/"skater") board (maybe add flow for "later board")
  - Repeat
 
 - Create the following assets:
  - Character
  - 3 obstacles (manhole, roadblock, trashbag, car)
  - Level ("treadmill"), i.e street
  - Background (sky moving at distance)
 
 - Create "speedy" (emotion of the sort) soundtrack

 - Reimplement jump mechanic
